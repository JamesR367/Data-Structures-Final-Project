Archer's dungeon is a text based dungeon game about an archer clearing out dungeons. In the game you can upgrade your stats by finding 
upgrade scrolls from bosses. With an upgrade scroll there are 5 stats health, armor, bow strength, accuracy.

The shop is where you buy health potions and arrows. You'll be able to buy normal arrows in the shop but you can find stronger arrows 
defeating enemies and in chests. Health potions come in weak, average, and strong all healing different amounts of health.

A dungeon is complete when the character leaves through the entrance or runs out of health. The player is allowed to leave the dungeon
at any time though they will not be able to go into the same dungeon again. If the player leaves by running out of health then money 
will be deducted from their account and they will end up back in the village.
